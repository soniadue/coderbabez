        TESTING TESTING TESTING 
        Ok, coderbabez â€“ let's do a quick review of HTML + CSS and then start intoducing some JavaScript. Every project will require HTML + CSS and we will improve our mastery overtime, so don't freak out if you still feel confused by some of the concepts. JavaScript is going to allow us to take some of our static pages we've built and make them dynamic.
